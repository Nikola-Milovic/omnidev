OmniDev treats MCP servers as capabilities. Define them in `omni.toml`, then enable them in profiles like any other capability.

## Transport types

| Transport | Use case | Required fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stdio` | Local process (default) | `command` |
| `http` | Remote HTTP server | `url` |
| `sse` | Server-Sent Events (deprecated) | `url` |

## Security and versioning notes

MCP servers can see what you send them, and their tool responses can influence downstream behavior. Treat MCP configuration like adding a dependency with network and data access.

### `stdio` (local) servers

- Prefer **pinned versions** for package-based servers. For example, instead of relying on “latest”, include an explicit version in the package spec:
  - `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@1.2.3`
- If you run a local server from your repo, consider pinning via your lockfile/tooling (e.g., `package.json` + lockfile) instead of `npx` downloading arbitrary versions at runtime.

### `http` (remote) servers

- You generally **cannot pin** the remote server implementation from the client side. Assume it can change at any time.
- Only use remote MCP providers you trust to handle your data securely. A compromised or malicious provider can potentially:
  - exfiltrate sensitive inputs you send to tools,
  - return tool outputs designed to steer behavior in unexpected ways.
- Prefer least-privilege credentials, rotate tokens, and consider isolating MCP usage to environments where data exposure is acceptable.

## stdio example

```toml
[mcps.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path"]
env = { SOMENAME = "SOMEVALUE", SOMEVALUE = "$SOME_ENV_VALUE" }
```

Optional fields:

- `args`: command arguments
- `cwd`: working directory
- `env`: environment variables

## http example

```toml
[mcps.notion]
transport = "http"
url = "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" }
```

## sse example (deprecated)

```toml
[mcps.legacy]
transport = "sse"
url = "https://example.com/sse"
```

## Enable in a profile

```toml
[profiles.default]
capabilities = ["filesystem", "notion"]
```

## Add via CLI

```bash
omnidev add mcp filesystem --command npx --args "-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path"
```

After changes, run:

```bash
omnidev sync
```

## How it works

When you define `[mcps.name]`, OmniDev:

1. Generates a synthetic capability under `.omni/capabilities/name/`
2. Writes a `capability.toml` with metadata
3. Includes the server in the generated `.mcp.json`

## Environment variables

Use `${VAR}` to reference values from your shell or environment files:

```toml
[mcps.database]
command = "node"
args = ["./mcp-server.js"]
env = { DB_URL = "${DATABASE_URL}" }
```
