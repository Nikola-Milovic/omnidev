OmniDev uses a small set of files to define what capabilities you want and how they are applied across providers.

## Core files

- `omni.toml`: main configuration (commit this)
- `omni.lock.toml`: pinned versions and commits (commit this)
- `omni.local.toml`: local overrides (gitignored)
- `OMNI.md`: project instructions (source of truth)
- `.omni/`: runtime state (gitignored)

## How configuration flows

1. You declare capability sources and profiles in `omni.toml`.
2. `omnidev sync` downloads capabilities and generates instructions from rules and docs.
3. Provider files like `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are generated from `OMNI.md` with instructions embedded directly.

## omni.toml

Main configuration file. You define capability sources, profiles, and MCP servers here.

See [Capability Sources](./capabilities) and [Profiles](./profiles) for the key sections you will edit most.

MCP details are documented in [Capabilities → MCP Servers](../capabilities/mcp-servers).

```toml
[capabilities.sources]
obsidian = "github:kepano/obsidian-skills"

[profiles.default]
capabilities = ["obsidian"]
```

## omni.lock.toml

Version lock file generated by `omnidev sync`. It records exact versions/commits of capability sources.

## omni.local.toml

Local overrides that are not committed. Useful for experimenting with capabilities without affecting teammates.

```toml
[profiles.default]
capabilities = ["my-local-cap"]
```

## OMNI.md

Single source of truth for project instructions. Provider files are generated from this file during sync.

See the dedicated [OMNI.md guide](./omni-md).

## .omni/

Runtime directory containing downloaded capabilities and state.

- `.omni/capabilities/` holds fetched sources
- `.omni/state/` holds runtime state (manifest, providers, active profile)
