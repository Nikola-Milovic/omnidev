# Task Planning Skill

When the user asks you to plan a task or break down work:

1. **Identify the goal** - Understand what the user wants to achieve
2. **List prerequisites** - Note any dependencies or requirements
3. **Break into steps** - Create actionable, ordered steps
4. **Estimate effort** - Consider complexity of each step
5. **Identify blockers** - Note potential issues

## Example Usage

User: "Help me refactor the authentication module"

Response:
1. Read current auth implementation
2. Identify coupling points with other modules
3. Design new interface
4. Update tests first (TDD approach)
5. Implement changes incrementally
6. Run full test suite
7. Update documentation
