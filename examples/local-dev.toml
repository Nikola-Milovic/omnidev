# Local Development Configuration
# Loading capabilities from local directories for development and testing
#
# NOTE: All sources are commented because they require local directories.
# Uncomment and adjust paths for your local setup.

[capabilities.sources]
# Load capability from local directory (absolute path)
# my-tool = "file:///home/user/projects/my-capability"

# Load capability from relative path (relative to project root)
# local-exp = "file://./capabilities/experimental"

# Use local override for a GitHub capability while developing
# When ready, switch back to github:source
# my-fork = "file://./forks/some-capability"

# Example: Override a capability for local development
# In omni.local.toml (gitignored), you can override sources:
# standard = "file://./local/standard-dev"

[profiles.default]
# Uncomment capabilities as needed
# capabilities = ["my-tool", "local-exp"]
capabilities = []
